  HERE I lie close to the grave
  Of Old Bill Piersol,
  Who grew rich trading with the Indians, and who
  Afterwards took the Bankrupt Law
  And emerged from it richer than ever
  Myself grown tired of toil and poverty
  And beholding how Old Bill and other grew in wealth
  Robbed a traveler one Night near Proctor's Grove,
  Killing him unwittingly while doing so,
  For which I was tried and hanged.
  That was my way of going into bankruptcy.
  Now we who took the bankrupt law in our respective ways
  Sleep peacefully side by side.

  Have you seen walking through the village
  A Man with downcast eyes and haggard face?
  That is my husband who, by secret cruelty
  Never to be told, robbed me of my youth and my beauty;
  Till at last, wrinkled and with yellow teeth,
  And with broken pride and shameful humility,
  I sank into the grave.
  But what think you gnaws at my husband's heart?
  The face of what I was, the face of what he made me!
  These are driving him to the place where I lie.
  In death, therefore, I am avenged.

  She took my strength by minutes,
  She took my life by hours,
  She drained me like a fevered moon
  That saps the spinning world.
  The days went by like shadows,
  The minutes wheeled like stars.
  She took the pity from my heart,
  And made it into smiles.
  She was a hunk of sculptor's clay,
  My secret thoughts were fingers:
  They flew behind her pensive brow
  And lined it deep with pain.
  They set the lips, and sagged the cheeks,
  And drooped the eye with sorrow.
  My soul had entered in the clay,
  Fighting like seven devils.
  It was not mine, it was not hers;
  She held it, but its struggles
  Modeled a face she hated,
  And a face I feared to see.
  I beat the windows, shook the bolts.
  I hid me in a corner
  And then she died and haunted me,
  And hunted me for life.
